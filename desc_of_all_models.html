    <h2 style="color: #34495e; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 26px;">GOMS model of human-computer interaction:</h2>
    <strong>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">
            GOMS is short for Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection. It was introduced in 1983 by  Stuart K. Card, Thomas P. Moran and Allen Newell. GOMS model consist of a single high level task, which is then broken down into further tasks and then into basic operations.The inventors of this model were able to achieve 90% correct predictions of user commands.
        </p>
    </strong>

    <h2 style="color: #34495e; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 26px;">
        The four elements of GOMS model:
    </h2>
        <ul style="font-size: large;">
            <p>
                1. Goals -: The goal of a user is what a user wants to achieve, it is also taken as a memory point in the model later on, so that he may evaluate if the goal has been reached. If not, what error has been caused.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Operators -: Operators are the basic action a user takes that may change the state of the system or will atleast change the state of user's thought process. They can also be termed as 'Commands'.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Methods -: When a user performs a goal, the path that has been taken is to complete the tasks or goal itself is called a method. Methods have sub-tasks within themselves too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Selection -: Selecting a method out of several methods is also an element of GOMS.However, we must understand that the method selection has been done based on previous actions as it is to be predictive, it is not necesarily just a choice of the user.

    Norman's model of human-computer interaction:
    </h2>
    <strong>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">
        The Norman's model of interaction is considered a very human friendly model that demonstrates the best way a user can interact with the computer.It has seven main steps for user to excecute the action and then evaluate the outcome, therefore also called the 'excecution-evaluation cycle'.

    <h3 style="color: #34495e; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 24px;">
        Norman's model of interaction are as follows:
    </h3>
    
            <ul style="font-size: large;">
                <p">
                    1. Establishing the goal.

                    2. Forming the intention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Specifying the action sequence.

                <p>
                    4. Executing the action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Perceiving the system state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6. Interpreting the system state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    7. Evaluating the system state with respect to the goals and intentions.

    <h2>KLM model of human-computer interaction:</h2>
    <strong>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">
            KLM has lots of similarirties with the GOMS model as it does predictions about user but, it has more of a quantitative aspect rather than an analytic one. The user has already been given seven operators to test around their cognitive approaches to the computer.
        </p>
    </strong>

    <h2>
        The seven operators of Keystroke-Level model is :
    </h2>
        <ul style="font-size: large;">
            <p>1. [K] Keystroking, actually striking keys, including shifts and other modifier keys.</p>
            <p>2. [B] Pressing a mouse button.</p>
            <p>3. [P] Pointing, moving the mouse (or similar device) at a target.</p>
            <p>4. [H] Homing, switching the hand between mouse and keyboard.</p>
            <p>5. [D] Drawing lines using the mouse.</p>
            <p>6. [M] Mentally preparing for a physical action.</p>
            <p>7. [R] System response which may be ignored if the user does not have to wait for it, as
            in copy typing.</p>
